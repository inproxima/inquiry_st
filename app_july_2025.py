                Student-Centered Learning:

                Create opportunities for students to take an active role in their learning. Encourage them to pose questions, investigate solutions, and construct their own understanding. Outline activities that allow for student choice and voice.
                Collaborative Learning:

                Incorporate activities that promote learning as a social process. Plan for students to collaborate with peers, teachers, and experts, sharing ideas and constructing knowledge collectively. Include group projects or discussions that require teamwork.
                Interdisciplinary Approach:

                Integrate multiple disciplines into the lesson plan, allowing students to see connections and apply knowledge in various contexts. Ensure the lesson draws on concepts from different subject areas to provide a holistic learning experience.
                Critical Thinking and Problem Solving:

                Develop activities that encourage students to think critically, question assumptions, analyze information, and solve complex problems. Include scenarios or problems that require deep thinking and innovative solutions. 
                Ongoing Assessment and Feedback:

                Integrate assessment into the learning process, providing ongoing feedback to guide students' inquiry and deepen their understanding. Plan formative assessments, peer reviews, and reflective activities that help monitor progress.
                Teacher as Facilitator:

                Outline the teacher's role in guiding and supporting students' inquiries. Describe how the teacher will provide resources, ask probing questions, and scaffold learning as needed to help students reach their goals.
                Reflective Practice:

                Include opportunities for both students and teachers to engage in reflection. Plan activities where students can assess their learning process, outcomes, and their roles within it. Describe how the teacher will facilitate reflection to promote continuous improvement.
