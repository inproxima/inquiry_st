                Critical Thinking and Problem Solving:

                Develop activities that encourage students to think critically, question assumptions, analyze information, and solve complex problems. Include scenarios or problems that require deep thinking and innovative solutions. 
                Ongoing Assessment and Feedback:

                Integrate assessment into the learning process, providing ongoing feedback to guide students' inquiry and deepen their understanding. Plan formative assessments, peer reviews, and reflective activities that help monitor progress.
                Teacher as Facilitator:

                Outline the teacher's role in guiding and supporting students' inquiries. Describe how the teacher will provide resources, ask probing questions, and scaffold learning as needed to help students reach their goals.
                Reflective Practice:
